Assignment name: Homework Assignment Code Quiz

I attempted to implement Bootstrap carosoul but I had some issues with the carousel being laggy. Also I have buttons with class btn wrapped in a div buttoncon and buttoncon2. The first and fourth button are clickable, but the 2 middle ones are not and I couldnt figy=ure out why. The slide I set up to start on click and set for 10 seconds each.There are event listeners on the correct answers to increment the score for every correct answwer. Sinc I couldnt figure out the button problem there is also no score saved to local storage or high score.
