Homework Assignment Code quiz

I attempted to implement Bootstrap carosoul but I had some issues with the carousel being laggy. Also I have buttons with class btn wrapped in a div buttoncon and buttoncon2. The first and fourth button are clickable, but the 2 middle ones are not and I couldnt figy=ure out why. The slide I set up to start on click and set for 10 seconds each.There are event listeners on the correct answers to increment the score for every correct answwer. Sinc I couldnt figure out the button problem there is also no score saved to local storage or high score.

Also in Github pages nothing at all seems to be working, except the buttons which are now ironically clickable.
